# Influence-Analysis
A ML model to figure out your friends and enemies

To run this model, you'll need:
- Username & password for a (basic) Twitter account. Learn more from Scweet's GitHub page.
- A positive/negative sentence classifier. Unfortunately my classifier is too large for GitHub.
- Patience. This model can take forever to collect data.

If you just want to quickly try out the model without dealing with all of the above, set `unfinished` to `False` in main.py and the model will use the included sample data instead.
